WannaCry wreaked havoc by exploiting a weakness in Microsoft Windows. It spread through sketchy email attachments and took advantage of a flaw in Windows, rapidly infecting computers. The biggest risk was that WannaCry encrypted files on computers, with attackers demanding payment in cryptocurrency to unlock them. This had severe consequences on various sectors, causing financial losses and disruptions. WannaCry exploited a vulnerability that Microsoft had already released a fix for, highlighting the importance of timely software updates and keeping security patches current. The attack could have been prevented by simply applying the available security patch and maintaining up-to-date backups. Network segmentation and stringent access controls could have also limited the spread of the malware.

NotPetya pretended to be ransomware but turned out to be a wiper malware. It spread through compromised software updates, specifically targeting organizations with Ukrainian ties. Once inside a network, it moved fast, encrypting files and rendering systems useless. NotPetya caused widespread data destruction, disrupting critical infrastructure and resulting in significant financial losses. It raised concerns about state-sponsored cyber-attacks and the unintended damage they could cause.

Phishing and BEC attacks involve tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that can compromise security. Attackers often send deceptive emails that appear legitimate, aiming to manipulate recipients into sharing credentials, transferring funds, or clicking on malicious links. The primary risk is unauthorized access to sensitive information or financial losses resulting from fraudulent activities. BEC attacks, in particular, target employees with financial responsibilities and have led to significant financial losses for organizations.
